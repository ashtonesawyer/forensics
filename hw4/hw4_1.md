# Summary
This report invesitages the thumbdrive of Alison Origin and the hard drive of Kelly Copy. 
Timelines of the respective devices shows that Origin created her work before Copy, and that
Copy had access to Origin's work during the time she was writing her proposal. 

# Purpose
This investigation's purpose was to examine Kelly Copy's hard drive and Allison Origin's 
thumbdrive to search for evidence that Copy did or did not plagarize Origin's work. 

# Methodology
I started by examining the thumbdrive image `tim.dd`. I used `mmls` to find the partitions,
followed by `fls` to examine the contents.
```
 $ mmls tim.dd
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

	  Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000000001   0000000002   Unallocated
002:  000:000   0000000002   0015950591   0015950590   Win95 FAT32 (0x0b)

 $ fls -o 2 tim.dd
r/r 3:  ALISON      (Volume Label Entry)
r/r 5:  ._.Trashes
...
/r * 69:       Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx
r/r 74: ._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx
r/r 77: ._Service.xlsx
v/v 254711427:  $MBR
...
```

The `fls` output confirms that the drive contains information relevant to the 
investigation. In order to examine it more closely, I used `fls` and `mactime`
to create a timeline of the events on the filesystem. Origin said she was working in 
Microsoft Word, so I searched through the timeline for .docx activity.
```
 $ fls -l -m "/" -z CST6CDT -f fat32 -r -o 2 tim.dd > body.txt
 $ mactime -b body.txt -z CST6CDT -d > tim.csv
 $ cat tim.csv | grep "Date,\|.docx"
Date,Size,Type,Mode,UID,GID,Meta,File Name
Xxx Xxx 00 0000 00:00:00,337839,..c.,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,69,"/Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx (deleted)"
Xxx Xxx 00 0000 00:00:00,4096,..c.,r/rr-xr-xr-x,0,0,74,"/._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx"
Mon Jul 13 2015 00:00:00,337839,.a..,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,69,"/Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx (deleted)"
Mon Jul 13 2015 00:00:00,4096,.a..,r/rr-xr-xr-x,0,0,74,"/._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx"
Mon Jul 13 2015 11:36:06,337839,m..b,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,69,"/Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx (deleted)"
Mon Jul 13 2015 11:36:06,4096,m..b,r/rr-xr-xr-x,0,0,74,"/._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx
```

I then used `icat` to recover the file `Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx` based
on it's inode (listed under the `Meta` header in the output above) and then prepared to 
examine its metadata. 
```
 $ icat -f fat32 -o 2 tim.dd 69 > recovered.docx
 $ mkdir recovered
 $ cp recovered.docx ~/recovered/recovered.zip
 $ cd ~/recovered; unzip recovered.zip
Archive:  recovered.zip
  inflating: [Content\_Types].xml
...
```

I used `xmllint` to inspect the metadata.
```
 $ xmllint --format docProps/core.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<cp:coreProperties xmlns:cp="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core-properties" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:dcmitype="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

```

Then I moved on to inspecting the hardrive image `tim2.dd`. I started by creating a timeline
using `log2timeline.py`.
```
 $log2timeline --vss_stores 3 --volumes all --hashers all --parsers webhist,win7,win7_slow,win_gen --storage-file tim2.plaso tim2.dd
 > yes
plaso - log2timeline version 20240303

...
Processing completed.

Number of warnings generated while extracting events: 23.

Use pinfo to inspect warnings in more detail.
```

I then used `psort.py` to get the output in a readable csv format.
```
 $ psort.py --output_time_zone "CST6CDT" -w tim2.csv -o dynamic tim2.plaso
plaso - psort version 20240303

...
Processing completed.
```

To get a smaller set to work with I first sorted by relevant file types and names. The 
first 66 lines of `new.csv` were from 2011 and previous, so they were also trimmed. 
All throughout the header was preserved to aid readability.
```
 $ cat tim2.csv | grep "datetime,\|.docx\|Proposal\." > new.csv
 $ { head -n1 new.csv; tail -n +66 new.csv; } > trim.csv
```

I accessed the actual files by mounting the drive to my system. I attempted to inspect the 
metadata of `Proposal.doc` using `wvWare` but was unsuccessful. 
```
 $ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o loop,ro,noexec tim2.dd ~/out
 $ cd out/Users/Kelly\ Copy/Desktop/Grant
 $ cp Proposal.doc ~; cd
 $ wvSummary Proposal.doc
Metadata for Proposal.doc:
Segmentation fault
```
 
# Findings
Based on the metadata, `Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx` was created 07/13/2015 at
16:28:00 UTC (11:28 CDT) by Alison Origin using Microsoft Macintosh Word. The timeline created 
for the thumbdrive says that the file was created at 11:36:06, referencing the time that the 
file was uploaded to the device. 

These are the relvant findings from `trim.csv`. All entries were from 2015-07-13.

Lines 7,8,15 show a shortcut to `Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx` being 
created in the system. Line 21 shows the last time the file was accessed. Line 38 shows
`Proposal.doc` being created. Line 67 shows `Proposal.doc` being edited. Line 75 shows
`Proposal.pdf` being created. Lines 137,138 show `Treatment...` being renamed to 
`$RC0GUWE.docx`. Line 144 shows `$RC0GUWE.docx` being deleted.

Simply comparing the contents of `Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx` and 
`Proposal.pdf` shows that many of the images and much of the text is identical. 

# Conclusions
The findings show that Alison Origin's work was created before Kelly Copy's, as well as
the fact that Copy had access to Origin's work during the creation of her own. In addition
to the similarities between the documents, this indicates that Copy did plagarize Origin's work
in her proposal.
