# Summary

# Purpose
This investigation's purpose was to examine Kelly Copy's hard drive and Allison Origin's 
thumbdrive to search for evidence that Copy did or did not plagarize Origin's work. 

# Methodology
I started by examining the thumbdrive image `tim.dd`. I used `mmls` to find the partitions,
followed by `fls` to examine the contents.
```
 $ mmls tim.dd
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

	  Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000000001   0000000002   Unallocated
002:  000:000   0000000002   0015950591   0015950590   Win95 FAT32 (0x0b)

 $ fls -o 2 tim.dd
r/r 3:  ALISON      (Volume Label Entry)
r/r 5:  ._.Trashes
...
/r * 69:       Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx
r/r 74: ._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx
r/r 77: ._Service.xlsx
v/v 254711427:  $MBR
...
```

The `fls` output confirms that the drive contains information relevant to the 
investigation. In order to examine it more closely, I used `fls` and `mactime`
to create a timeline of the events on the filesystem. Origin said she was working in 
Microsoft Word, so I searched through the timeline for .docx activity.
```
 $ fls -l -m "/" -z CST6CDT -f fat32 -r -o 2 tim.dd > body.txt
 $ mactime -b body.txt -d > tim.csv
 $ cat tim.csv | grep "Date,\|.docx"
Date,Size,Type,Mode,UID,GID,Meta,File Name
Xxx Xxx 00 0000 00:00:00,337839,..c.,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,69,"/Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx (deleted)"
Xxx Xxx 00 0000 00:00:00,4096,..c.,r/rr-xr-xr-x,0,0,74,"/._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx"
Sun Jul 12 2015 22:00:00,337839,.a..,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,69,"/Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx (deleted)"
Sun Jul 12 2015 22:00:00,4096,.a..,r/rr-xr-xr-x,0,0,74,"/._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx"
Mon Jul 13 2015 09:36:06,337839,m..b,r/rrwxrwxrwx,0,0,69,"/Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx (deleted)"
Mon Jul 13 2015 09:36:06,4096,m..b,r/rr-xr-xr-x,0,0,74,"/._Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx"
```

I then used `icat` to recover the file `Treatment Plant Results of Purification.docx` based
on it's inode (listed under the `Meta` header in the output above) and then prepared to 
examine its metadata. 
```
 $ icat -f fat32 -o 2 tim.dd 69 > recovered.docx
 $ mkdir recovered
 $ cp recovered.docx ~/recovered/recovered.zip
 $ cd ~/recovered; unzip recovered.zip
Archive:  recovered.zip
  inflating: [Content\_Types].xml
...
```

I used `xmllint` to inspect the metadata.
```
 $ xmllint --format docProps/core.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<cp:coreProperties xmlns:cp="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core-properties" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:dcmitype="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

```

Then I moved on to inspecting the hardrive image `tim2.dd`. I started by creating a timeline
using `log2timeline.py`.
```
 $ log2timeline --vss\_stores 3 --storage-file tim2.dump tim2.dd
 > yes
plaso - log2timeline version 20240303

Source path             : /home/sawyeras/tim2.dd

... 

Processing completed.

Number of warnings generated while extracting events: 17.

Use pinfo to inspect warnings in more detail.
```

I then used `psort.py` to get the output in a readable csv format.
```
 $ psort --output-time-zone "CST6CDT" -w tim2.csv -o l2tcsv tim2.dump
plaso - psort version 20240303

Storage file            : tim2.dump

...

Processing completed.
```

To get a smaller set to work with I first sorted by relevant file types. The first 65 lines 
of `new.csv` were from 2011 and previous, so they were also trimmed. All throughout the header
was preserved to aid readability.
```
 $ cat tim2.csv | grep "date,time\|.docx" > new.csv
 $ { head -n1 new.csv; tail -n +65 new.csv} > trim.csv
```
