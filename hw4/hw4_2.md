# What is the MAC address for the missing MBP and Android Phone?
8C:3A:E3:97:67:37 has to be the phone because it's the only non-Apple product. The MBP
is 6C:40:08:92:D5:D0 because it's named Schmos-MBP in the DHCP logs.

jerk was using devices with the MAC addresses 8C-3A-E3-97-67-37 (John's android)
and 6C-40-08-92-D5-D0 (John's MBP)

# Is it be reasonable to think that the login failures are attempts to break into jschmo's account?
It's possible since there were 30 consecutive failed logins on 2014-07-11 between
09:16:52 and 12:23:52 (a short period of time) and there isn't a successful login until 
2014-08-18 at 12:41:12 for a total of 194 consecutive failed logins. Most of the logins 
are from the LG phone (MAC 8C:3A:E3:97:67:37) and the ones during that time that don't come
from the LG come from the iPhone (MAC 68:A8:6D:55:66:DA). However these are from a while ago
and ostensibly John still had his phones. There are more long strings of failed logins on
2014-04-30, 2015-05-01, and 2015-05-07, which are more recent given that the logs go until 
2015-06-19. If it is someone trying to break into his account, it's a very concerted effort
over a long period of time.
